Mostly of assets in this mod are a compilation of another mods, where some of them were prepared to use in conjuntion with ControlC mod and Mio Road Assets.
I had transformed and updated the intersections to be used as an assets from the RoadExchange group in the game.

## DISCLAIMER
* Safe to remove. This mod will not break your save if removed. However the assets will no longer work.
* This mod may require ***Asset Packs Manager*** which is highly experimental. This mod shouldn't break the save game. But subscribing to assets that require this without the dependency will pop up errors. Worst case you'll get error popups on game load and/or grey boxes in save. But either way, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any damage.</LongDescription>
